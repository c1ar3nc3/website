      <h2>Project of Heart</h2>
        <p>Project of heart commemorates the lives of thousands of Indigenous people who have lost their lives as a result of the residential school experience. It empowers students to call Canadians to action, through social justice endeavours to change our present and future collectively. In acknowledging the loss suffered by many, we gain a deeper understanding of the strength, wisdom and resilience of the First Nations peoples of this land. This is a 6-8 week project-based lesson. Students participate in inquiry-based, hands-on, collaborative, artistic journey of truth seeking & honouring of all survivors of the residential school experience. There are various project options for activities leading upto the final "Reconciliation" art piece, as well as various special event to conclude this ReconciliACTION program. Contact artist for further details!</p>
