        <h2>"The Great War" Oral Histories of the Wetsu'wet'en</h2>
          <p>This presentation is designed for an all-inclusive environment. Candice will begin by sharing the oral history of "The Great War". This oral story explains the creation of the traditional governance system, also known as the clan system or Bahlats. Oral histories were told to teach; morals, traditional roles, values and responsibilities. This oral story was told since time immemorial to pass on the history of how the clan system came to be. It also addresses two social justice issues prevalent today; Missing and Murdered Indigenous Woman and Men, and the "Me too" movement. This oral history was told to prevent harmful behavior from happening in the future. Candice will follow the story with preventative education and conclude with a question period and honour song.</p>
