          <p>I have had the pleasure of working with Candice at Beaverly Elementary School. Candice has brought a wealth of Aboriginal knowledge to our school. She has worked with our students on singing and teaching traditional songs. She helped teach our grade 1 students songs for our Christmas concert, our grade 4/5 class learn a farewell song. She introduced drum making. dance and art. She worked on tanning process of a moose hide with our school. The knowledge and skills she begins has been invaluable. Candice eagerly engages our students. She is a team player and works well with our Aboriginal Education Worker. Candice's caring nature makes her a pleasure to be around. Candice has been a strong role model for our Aboriginal students. Students have felt comfortable sharing their experiences with her and are keen to ask questions about language and culture. Her ideas are creative, innovative and always well received by all.

          <p>Candice George worked with my students and I on a project combining local First Nation oral stories and stop motion technology. At the beginning of the unit, Candice George read and discussed a variety of oral stories during her weekly visits to our class. What made these stories powerful to our students was that they referenced local landmarks that many students knew and had visited. After we had read the stories, small groups of students selected one each and began developing them into stop motion movies. Candice provided all of the materials needed for the project, including craft materials and cameras. Over the next several weeks, she helped guide the students in the creation of their movies. My students not only deepened their understanding of local First Nations oral stories, but also gained valuable art, video, and sound editing skills during this unit. I highly recommend this project to other educators. We presented our stop motion movies to our school during our Indigenous Games celebrations, in which Candice was also an engaging leader and facilitator. They received great feedback from teachers, parents, and other students. It was such a large project and it would not have been possible without Candice's expertise and guidance.

          <p>I've had the pleasure of attending many events that Candice has held at our school, Nusdeh Yoh, a First Nations Choice School. From what I've observed of Candice, she exudes a hard-working, positive attitude and exhibits great leadership. Candice has great school spirit; she shares rich cultural experiences with our students and has a positive, professional attitude.<br>

          <p>She is a talented dancer and performer - always connecting with her audience. Her enthusiastic work with students and staff makes her a pleasure to work with. Candice is a true professional always looking to improve. She has mentored many colleagues in our school district. Her example to her colleagues has been tremendously professional. She has excellent interpersonal skills and has shown me, students and colleagues that she is able to communicate effectively with others.
